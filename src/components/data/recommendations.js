      content="I have loved working with Ryan for almost six years now. He was cheerful, he was inquisitive, he was a problem-solver, and he was extremely versatile. As a front end developer he was very collaborative, which was helpful when we had tight deadlines and brand restrictions; Ryan was always quick to jump on a call or grab a room and throw out some creative solutions. If you wanted a super talented, reliable, positive force on your team, Ryan’s your man."

      content="Ryan worked on my development team for the past 6 years. During his time on the team he could be counted on to deliver completed work at a consistent, efficient, and reliable pace. He was often the highest throughput member of the team sprint-by-sprint. We have some unique implementations with our technology stack and with each one as Ryan became familiar with them he was able to operate as a significant contributing member to the team both in productivity and problem solving. As a teammate in general, Ryan is friendly, approachable, and collaborative. He enjoys getting to know his teammates and supporting them both with their tasks and questions, but also as a friend. His attitude and demeanor sitting in a group setting at the office are often worthwhile attributes that impact the team in a positive way in their day-to-day. I found Ryan to be talented, reliable, and efficient with his work. Any team looking for a quality development resource who can dial in the front-end aspects of their project will find him to be a value add across the board."
